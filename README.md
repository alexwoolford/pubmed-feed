# PubMed feed

This project monitors publications on PubMed for a number of doctors. 



## ideas/thoughts

- if PubMed ID's are based on an incrementing integer, it would be really easy to capture/persist all the abstracts, and not just the ones that are returned by the search list of doctors.

## to do

1. capture all the authors for each paper
2. FreeMarker template to generate HTML
3. expose functionality as RESTful web service
4. schedule refreshes
